# Raft Consensus Project (CSE707)

This repository contains an implementation of the **Raft consensus algorithm** written in Go.


## Project Structure

The project is divided into **three parts**:

1. **Part 1 – Leader Election**
2. **Part 2 – Commands and Log Replication**
3. **Part 3 – Dynamic Membership**

Each part:
- Is located in its own directory
- Contains a `test_raft.go` file
- Uses Go test cases to drive the Raft implementation

---

## Test Files

All Raft tests are defined in: raft_test.go

Test functions follow Go’s standard naming convention:

```go
func TestExampleName(t *testing.T) {
    // test logic
}

## How to Run the Project

### General Rule

Raft is executed by running **Go test commands**.

You can run:

- A single test function  
- All tests in one part  
- All test html visualization tool 


### A Single Test Function

To run one specific test function, use the `-run` flag:

```bash
go test -v -run TestFunctionName
```

### All Tests in One Part

To run all test functions in a single project part, navigate to that part’s directory and run:

```bash
go test -v


### All Tests HTML Visualization

This project provides an **HTML log visualization tool** that converts Raft test logs into an interactive timeline view.

The visualization helps analyze:
- Leader elections
- Term changes
- RPC communication
- Log replication and commits

---

#### How to Generate the Visualization

To generate an HTML visualization for all tests in a project part, use the provided PowerShell script:

**Steps:**

1. Go to the desired project part directory:

2. Run the visualization script:

```bash
.\dotest.ps1
